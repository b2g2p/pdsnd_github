### Project Title
BikeShare Project

### Description
In this project, I used  Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics

### Files used
Data files such as chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv
